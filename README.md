## Build instructions
Clone and load the project source. Make sure to add the contents of the jars folder to your Build Path as External jars. There is a gimmick with EasyOgg that it requires the music folder to be in the bin foler. So it looks for the songs in bin/music/. Requires Java 7.

## Story
You -- Captain Manol, an old scurvy dog of a pirate, will go on a journey to invade the aliens' space! Can you defeat the hordes of alien spaceships? Master the easily overheating space weapons: machine guns, rockets launchers and lazers! Will you prevail? Yarr, matey!
